09h00:13h00 introduction to the team, specifications on how the company works (tooling, etc.) and the task at hand.

13h30:15h00 looking for HAL crates on crates.io, embassy (cooperative async framework (can run multiple executors)) seems to have proper support, the other HAL that is more aimed at interop with RTIC (time-critical interrupt-driven framework) is not yet implemented. Only on nightly via a git dependency it seems to be usable.

15h00:17h00 set up basic program that uses EXTI interrupt to wait for the button on the board to be pressed. Checking out defmt for logging tomorrow maybe.
