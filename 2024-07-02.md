09h00:11h00 Try baremetal program, doesn't work either throug linker errors, with linker satisfied it doesn't seem to do anything, stashed for now, trying when I am more certain of time to spare.

11h00:12h00 Trying to set up debugging, needs STM32CubeIDE probably for the Cortex-M Debug configuration in vscode, trying to install that now.

12h00:13h00 Different error now, upgrading stlink firmware with stm32cubeide.

13h30:16h00 Starting on a comparable STM32CubeIDE project. Default tools from CubeIDE still relied on obsolete .so file that is not available anymore for current version of ubuntu. So tried building with local installed tools, had to dig deep into the compiler flag configs from cubeIDE to disable one of them, now build configurations can launch properly.

initial tests for setting a pin:

| Task             | Rust (embassy) | C (ST Cube HAL) |
| :--------------- | :------------: | :-------------: |
| Set LED high/low |      7.25      |       10        |
| Toggle pin       |      8.5       |      11.25      |

both still need some tweaking with optimization flags, but both had some of the basic ones enabled.
